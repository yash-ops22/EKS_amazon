# EKS_amazon: 
# Kubernetes
 Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration
 system for automating computer application deployment, 
 scaling, and management. It was originally designed
 by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native
 Computing Foundation.

# Elastic Kuberntets Service
   Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is
   a managed service that makes it easy for you to 
   run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to stand 
   up or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane.
   Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating
   the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized 
   applications.
   Amazon EKS runs Kubernetes control plane instances across
   multiple Availability Zones to ensure high availability.
   Amazon EKS automatically detects and replaces unhealthy 
   control plane instances, and it provides automated version 
   upgrades and patching for them.
